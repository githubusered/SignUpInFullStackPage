# SignUpInFullStackPage

## Description

The **SignUpInFullStackPage** project is a two-page small web application built using React and Node.js. It provides users with the ability to sign up and sign in, while also securely storing user data in a MongoDB cluster.

### Features

- **Sign Up and Sign In:** The application offers a user-friendly interface to sign up and sign in. Users can create an account by providing their details, and existing users can securely log in.

- **MongoDB Integration:** User data is stored in a MongoDB database. When a user signs up, their information is stored in a MongoDB cluster, ensuring data persistence and security.

- **React Components:** The project is structured using functional React components. This allows for modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and extend the application.
